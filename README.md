This repository contains android application source code which can be imported in Android Studio. Currently it fetches all notifications, whatsapp chats, instagram chats in real time.

This app will not be shown in launcher apps list. It can only be seen from Settings > Apps.

This app source code contains mainly three servies AccessService, AccessServiceInsta.java and NotificationService.java.

This app is firebase dependent. You need to create android app in firebase console with same package id as this is.

It requires two accessibility permissions (need to be switched on from installed accessibility services of target device).
It also requires notification access permission.

A google-services.json file is needed in /app directory.

This google-services.json can be downloaded from firebase app configuration page.

After successfull installation and proper permissions, live notifications will be pushed in firebase realtime database.

Also, Whatsapp and Instagram Chats will be also pushed with person name (with device model) in node.
